# GEM-Code-Base
Code for the generation and analysis of valid triangulations, and previously collected data.

The code in this repository was made in Semester 2 2021 as part of a project for SCDL1991 at 
the University of Sydney. The code was designed to generate all triangulations with a given
number of vertices, for a given genus surface. [See report for more details on this]. 

Csv files containing already generated data have also been provided.
